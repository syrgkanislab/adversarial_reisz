# adversarial_reisz
Adversarial estimation of Reisz representers

To run the estimation you can open Results.ipynb on Google Colaboratory and run all the cells.

Alternatively, you can also run the estimation outside of Google Colab. Clone this repository, use the requirements.txt file to create a virtual environment, and run Results.ipynb within it. (It mimics the default Google Colab environment.)

Warning: The leftover files (not used for the paper) AdversarialReisz.ipynb and 401k.ipynb do not have a fixed seed for advnnet.
