# adversarial_reisz
Adversarial estimation of Reisz representers

To run the neural net example you can open AdversarialReisz.ipynb as a Colab notebook on google and run all the cells.
The first cells will mount your google drive. You need to place the github within your google drive and change
the cell that goes to the folder within your google drive to your own path.

Alternatively, use the requirements.txt file to create a virtual environment that mimics the default Google Colab environment to run things outside of Google Colab.

(Note: 401k_appli.py, charitable_appli.py, and test.ipynb have a fixed seed for all estimators, but AdversarialReisz.ipynb and 401k.ipynb do not have a fixed seed yet for advnnet.)
